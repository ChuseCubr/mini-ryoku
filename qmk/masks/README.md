# Mini-ryoku

A compact 34-key adaptation of the [Miryoku layout](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) for the [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep).

Check out the writeup at [Mini-ryoku](https://github.com/ChuseCubr/mini-ryoku).

## Masks

These files contain macros to map the Mini-ryoku layout to larger keyboards.

Note: These aren't keyboard specific, they're layout specific. The Corne mask (`crkbd.h`) should work with other 3x6+3 boards, as long as the keymap format is the same.
